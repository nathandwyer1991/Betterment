# Betterment - Robo Advisor Financial Advising
## Betterment, a financial advising fiduciary, was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman with the intention to combine the innovative and creative nature of human coding with the ability of tech to sift through large amounts of data and adapt to optimize success.(1) Jon sought to bring valuable financial services to a wider audience in order to provide a service that he believed had only benefited the wealthy to gather more wealth.(2) Since 2008, with the help of the current CEO, Sarah Levy, Betterment has over 750,000 customer accounts and raised over 160 million in growth capital in its goal to automize investing for the everyman and create wealth for those brave enough to seek it. Betterment has relatively low monthly costs and service fees compared to other providers of this service charging only 4 dollars a month + .25% for investing accounts and only 1% + trading expenses for crypto trading. These fees, along with investments from groups such as Bessemer Venture Partners, the Anthemis Group and Citi Venture, allow Betterment to continue to evolve and optimize to stay at the forefront of Robo Advising.
